## Random_Integer Task: 
A SHOW button displays array containing integers on screen , 
the task is to display an array in which two randomly chosen numbers 
from the array are interchanged when the STOP button is pressed.

# Concept :-

## Generating Random Number:
* Returns a random integer between min (inclusive) and max (inclusive).
 * The value is no lower than min (or the next integer greater than min
 * if min isn't an integer) and no greater than max (or the next integer
 * lower than max if max isn't an integer).
 * Using Math.round() will give you a non-uniform distribution!

## Swapping Two Numbers Using Third Variable
## Logic
The idea behind swapping two numbers using 3rd variable is simple. Store the value of 1st variable in temporary variable. Store the value of 2nd variable in the first variable. At last, store the value of temp variable in 2nd variable. In this program, we are using a temporary variable to hold the value of the first variable.

Assign var1 value to a temp variable: temp = var1

Assign var2 value to var1: var1 = var2

Assign temp value to var2: var2 = temp
## Research Conducted

The following program makes use of the concept of arrays, Buttons and methods in Javacript.
